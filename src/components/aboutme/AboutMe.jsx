            <p>I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life.

            I began my journey as a web developer in 2024, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, a year into my journey as a web developer, Iâ€™m building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Tailwindcss, Scss, Firebase, Epress.Js, Mongo DB and much more.

            <p>I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.</p>
